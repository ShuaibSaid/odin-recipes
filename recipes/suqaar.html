        <h2>Ma Halima's Beef Suqaar</h2>
        <p>This is Minnesota-based home cook Ma Halima's quick version of suqaar, a meat-and-vegetable stir-fry that's popular in her home country of Somalia.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
            <li>1 Â½ pounds boneless beef chuck or other stew meat, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 large carrots, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 small green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>Large handful of cilantro leaves, coarsely chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm oil in a large skillet (preferably cast iron) or other heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and onion, and sprinkle with a large pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until beef is browned in spots and onion is beginning to become tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add carrots and sprinkle cumin and turmeric over everything, along with another large pinch of salt. Stir in 1/4 cup water, cover, and cook until carrots are beginning to get tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in bell pepper, cover again, and cook until carrots and pepper are just barely tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off heat, stir in lime juice, and season to taste. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve immediately. Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container and rewarmed in a skillet set over low heat.</li>
        </ol>
